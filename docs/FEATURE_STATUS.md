## Known Limitations

1. **Event log delivery**: `get_events` is exposed but most builds return an empty event list because simulator-side event logging is not wired
2. **NumPy Dependency**: Fleet formations require NumPy (optional but recommended)
3. **No Replay System**: Recording exists but no replay viewer yet
4. **Limited AI**: AI controller has basic behaviors only
5. **No Damage Model**: Ships can be destroyed but no subsystem damage yet
