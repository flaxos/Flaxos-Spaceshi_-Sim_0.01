ðŸš€ Flaxos Spaceship Simulator

Overview

The Flaxos Spaceship Simulator is a modular and extensible simulation framework designed to simulate realistic spaceship mechanics, navigation, and fleet operations. It provides a robust environment for simulating various spacecraft, propulsion systems, and sensor suites within a realistic physics environment.

Key Features

Modular Architecture: Easily extendable with separate modules for core systems, fleets, and utility functions.

Hybrid Simulation: Supports both conventional and advanced propulsion methods.

Scenario-based Testing: Predefined scenarios for testing, training, and demonstrations.

Extensible Fleet Management: Easy integration and configuration of multiple spacecraft and states.
