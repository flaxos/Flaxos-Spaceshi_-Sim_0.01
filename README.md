# Spaceship Simulator

## Overview
A Python-based spaceship simulator featuring:
- Modular OOP/event-driven design
- Layered reactor power management (primary, secondary, tertiary)
- Weapon and hardpoint systems with power checks, heat, and cooldown

## Installation
1. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
   ```
Install dependencies (if any):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### CLI
```bash
python -m hybrid.cli --fleet-dir hybrid_fleet --run 60
```
`--fleet-dir` points to a directory of ship configuration files.

`--run` sets the simulation duration in seconds.

### GUI
```bash
python -m hybrid.gui.run_gui --config path/to/ships.json
```
Launches a Tkinter window. If no `--config` path is provided, the GUI will
use `ships_config.json` when present or prompt for a file using a standard
dialog. Edit `hybrid/gui/run_gui.py` to customize widgets.

### Sample Data
Minimal ship examples are provided in `fleet_json/sample_ship.json` and
`fleet/sample_ship.yaml`. Large event log files were removed to keep the
repository lightweight.

## Core Systems
**PowerManagementSystem** (`hybrid/systems/power/management.py`)

Manages three reactors: primary, secondary, tertiary.

`tick(dt)` handles ramp-up and overheating.

`request_power(amount, consumer)` draws from reactors in priority order.

`transfer_output(src, dest, amount)` allows emergency rerouting.

**WeaponSystem** (`hybrid/systems/weapons/weapon_system.py`)

Defines Weapon class: handles cooldown, heat, ammo, and power checks.

Defines WeaponSystem to manage multiple Weapon instances.

**Hardpoint** (`hybrid/systems/weapons/hardpoint.py`)

Mounts or unmounts Weapon objects.

Delegates `fire(...)` to its mounted Weapon.

**NavigationSystem** (`hybrid/systems/navigation/navigation.py`)

Placeholder: update ship movement logic here.

**SensorSystem** (`hybrid/systems/sensors/sensor_system.py`)

Placeholder: passive/active detection logic.

**Simulator** (`hybrid/simulator.py`)

Central loop that ticks all ships each frame.

## Development Roadmap
Completed:

- Tick-based simulation loop
- Layered power management (ramp, thermal)
- Basic weapon and hardpoint modules
- Core EventBus for pub/sub

In Progress:

- GUI integration (Tkinter skeleton)
- Sensor gameplay loops

Pending:

- Launch bay & ship hierarchy features
- Fleet‚Äêlevel scaling
- Advanced GUI controls (RCS buttons, contact panels)

## Testing
```bash
pytest --maxfail=1 -q
```
Tests cover reactor ramp/overheat, power prioritization, weapon cooldown/heat/ammo.
