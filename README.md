# ðŸš€ Flaxos Spaceship Simulator

## Project Overview

Flaxos Spaceship Simulator is a modular Python project for experimenting with realistic spaceship mechanics. A small event bus allows loosely coupled systems while both CLI and GUI frontâ€‘ends drive the simulation.

## Folder Structure

```
hybrid/
  core/           # base classes, event bus and constants
  systems/
    power/       # reactor and power management
    weapons/     # weapon logic and hardpoints
    navigation/  # navigation system
    sensors/     # sensor system
  cli/           # command line entry point
  gui/           # GUI entry point
```

Tests live under `tests/` with the same layout.

## Installation

1. Install **Python 3.10+**.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flaxos/Flaxos-Spaceshi_-Sim_0.01.git
   cd Flaxos-Spaceshi_-Sim_0.01
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running

Run the CLI simulation:
```bash
python -m hybrid.cli.run_cli --config path/to/ships.json
```

Launch the GUI:
```bash
python -m hybrid.gui.run_gui
```

The unified GUI loads scenarios, starts the simulation server and exposes
navigation, helm, sensors and power controls. A placeholder panel for weapons is
included for future work. The new power management system models reactor
rampâ€‘up, thermal limits and failover. Weapons will draw power via the management
system and build heat over time.

## Roadmap

Upcoming work includes launch bay mechanics, hierarchical ship components, fleetâ€‘level scaling and richer GUI controls.
